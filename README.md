# xGLfonts
Experimental

In progress, not worth looking at yet.

Port based loosely on https://github.com/astiopin/webgl_fonts, only 10% ported so far.
[initial documentation](https://nanjizal.github.io/xGLfonts/pages/)

- Currently just created data structures which are not WebGL/js specific
- WebGL aspects not started yet
- Moved one font's json to class data, to see if can be fully typed with Map's
- Perhaps OpenGL could also be supported but not a priority.
- not interested in rebuilding the demo prefer initially to aim pure code static test with Ubuntu font.
- have been moving the naming_style to namingStyle ( from snake to camel ? )
